 and must be passed to [USBDevice.EndControlTransfer(IAsyncResult)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbdevice.md#endcontroltransferiasyncresult) to retrieve the result of the operation. For every call to
 this method a matching call to
 [USBDevice.EndControlTransfer(IAsyncResult)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbdevice.md#endcontroltransferiasyncresult) must be made. When  specifies a callback
 function, this function will be called when the operation is completed. The optional
  parameter can be used to pass user-defined information to this callback or the
 [IAsyncResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult). The [IAsyncResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult)
 also provides an event handle ([IAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult.asyncwaithandle)) that will be triggered when the
 operation is complete as well.

### <a id="methods-begincontroltransfer"/>**BeginControlTransfer(Byte, Byte, Int32, Int32, AsyncCallback, Object)**

Initiates an asynchronous control transfer without a data stage over the default control endpoint. This method
 allows both IN and OUT direction transfers, depending
 on the highest bit of the  parameter. Alternatively,
 [USBDevice.BeginControlIn(Byte, Byte, Int32, Int32, Byte[], Int32, AsyncCallback, Object)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbdevice.md#begincontrolinbyte-byte-int32-int32-byte-int32-asynccallback-object) and

 control transfers in a specific direction, which is
 the recommended way because it prevents using the wrong direction accidentally. Use the BeginControlTransfer method
 when the direction is not
 known at compile time.

```csharp
public IAsyncResult BeginControlTransfer(byte requestType, byte request, int value, int index, AsyncCallback userCallback, object stateObject)
```

#### Parameters

The index member in the setup packet. Its meaning depends on the request. Index should be between
 zero and 65535 (0xFFFF).

`userCallback` [AsyncCallback](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.asynccallback)<br>
An optional asynchronous callback, to be called when the control transfer is complete. Can
 be null if no callback is required.

`stateObject` [Object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object)<br>

 if not required.

#### Returns

An [IAsyncResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult) object representing the asynchronous control transfer, which could still be
 pending.

**Remarks:**

This method always completes immediately even if the operation is still pending. The [IAsyncResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult)
 object returned represents the operation
 and must be passed to [USBDevice.EndControlTransfer(IAsyncResult)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbdevice.md#endcontroltransferiasyncresult) to retrieve the result of the operation. For every call to
 this method a matching call to
 [USBDevice.EndControlTransfer(IAsyncResult)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbdevice.md#endcontroltransferiasyncresult) must be made. When  specifies a callback
 function, this function will be called when the operation is completed. The optional
  parameter can be used to pass user-defined information to this callback or the
 [IAsyncResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult). The [IAsyncResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult)
 also provides an event handle ([IAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult.asyncwaithandle)) that will be triggered when the
 operation is complete as well.

`index` [Int32](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.int32)<br>
The index member in the setup packet. Its meaning depends on the request. Index should be between
 zero and 65535 (0xFFFF).

`buffer` [Span&lt;Byte&gt;](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.span-1)<br>
The data to transfer in the data stage of the control. When the transfer is in the IN direction the data received
 will be
 written to this buffer. For an OUT direction transfer the contents of the buffer are written sent through the pipe.
 The length of this
 buffer is used as the number of bytes in the control transfer. The setup packet's length member will be set to this
 length as well.

#### Returns

The number of bytes received from the device.

### <a id="methods-controltransfer"/>**ControlTransfer(Byte, Byte, Int32, Int32)**

Initiates a control transfer without a data stage over the default control endpoint. This method allows both IN and
 OUT direction transfers, depending
 on the highest bit of the  parameter). Alternatively,
 [USBDevice.ControlIn(Byte, Byte, Int32, Int32)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbdevice.md#controlinbyte-byte-int32-int32) and
 [USBDevice.ControlOut(Byte, Byte, Int32, Int32)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbdevice.md#controloutbyte-byte-int32-int32) can be used for control transfers in a specific direction, which is
 the recommended way because
 it prevents using the wrong direction accidentally. Use the ControlTransfer method when the direction is not known
 at compile time.

```csharp
public void ControlTransfer(byte requestType, byte request, int value, int index)
```

#### Parameters

`requestType` [Byte](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.byte)<br>

The value member in the setup packet. Its meaning depends on the request. Value should be between
 zero and 65535 (0xFFFF).

`index` [Int32](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.int32)<br>
The index member in the setup packet. Its meaning depends on the request. Index should be between
 zero and 65535 (0xFFFF).

### <a id="methods-controltransferasync"/>**ControlTransferAsync(Byte, Byte, Int32, Int32, Byte[], Int32)**

Asynchronously issue a sequence of bytes IO over the default control endpoint.
 This method allows both IN and OUT direction transfers, depending on the highest bit of the
  parameter.
 Alternatively, [USBDevice.ControlInAsync(Byte, Byte, Int32, Int32, Byte[], Int32)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbdevice.md#controlinasyncbyte-byte-int32-int32-byte-int32)
 and [USBDevice.ControlOutAsync(Byte, Byte, Int32, Int32, Byte[], Int32)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbdevice.md#controloutasyncbyte-byte-int32-int32-byte-int32) can be used for asynchronous control transfers in
 a specific direction,
 which is the recommended way because it prevents using the wrong direction accidentally.
 Use the BeginControlTransfer method when the direction is not known at compile time.

```csharp
public Task<Int32> ControlTransferAsync(byte requestType, byte request, int value, int index, Byte[] buffer, int length)

### <a id="methods-dispose"/>**Dispose(Boolean)**

Disposes the object

```csharp
protected void Dispose(bool disposing)
```

#### Parameters

`disposing` [Boolean](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.boolean)<br>
Indicates whether Dispose was called manually (true) or by
 the garbage collector (false) via the destructor.

### <a id="methods-dispose"/>**Dispose()**

Disposes the UsbDevice including all unmanaged WinUSB handles. This function
 should be called when the UsbDevice object is no longer in use, otherwise
 unmanaged handles will remain open until the garbage collector finalizes the
 object.

```csharp
public void Dispose()
```

### <a id="methods-endcontroltransfer"/>**EndControlTransfer(IAsyncResult)**

Waits for a pending asynchronous control transfer to complete.

```csharp
public int EndControlTransfer(IAsyncResult asyncResult)
```

#### Parameters

`asyncResult` [IAsyncResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult)<br>
The [IAsyncResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult) object representing the asynchronous operation,
 as returned by one of the ControlIn, ControlOut or ControlTransfer methods.

#### Returns

The number of bytes transferred during the operation.

**Remarks:**

Every asynchronous control transfer must have a matching call to [USBDevice.EndControlTransfer(IAsyncResult)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbdevice.md#endcontroltransferiasyncresult) to dispose
 of any resources used and to retrieve the result of the operation. When the operation was successful the method
 returns the number
 of bytes that were transferred. If an error occurred during the operation this method will throw the exceptions
 that
 would
 otherwise have occurred during the operation. If the operation is not yet finished EndControlTransfer will wait for
 the
 operation to finish before returning.
